# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that you’ve already combed through, you’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

The purpose of the following analysis is to analyze the sampling of kickstarter data, specific to plays, to provide visuals of how different campaigns fared with their outcomes focusing on goals and launch dates, to assist Louise in making decisions involving future kickstarter campaigns.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
While building and analyzing the Outcomes vs Goals, my graph was not appearing as expected.  Upon initial review of my "Countifs(...)" functions they appeared correct, so I searched Google to review how the criteria commands should be written.  My initial assumption was that "Live" campaigns were supposed to be included with the "successful" totals. 
After consulting a few different web pages regarding Excel "Countifs" functions I returned to my own functions and worked through each set of criteria.  The resulting issue was finally determined to be due to how the criteria needs to be written regarding a number within a range such as "1000 to 4999".

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
