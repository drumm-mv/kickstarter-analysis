### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
While building and analyzing the Outcomes vs Goals, my graph was not appearing as expected.  Upon initial review of my "Countifs(...)" functions they appeared correct, so I searched Google to review how the criteria commands should be written.  After consulting a few different pages regarding Excel "Countifs" functions I returned to my own functions and worked through each set of criteria.  The resulting issue was due to how the criteria needs to be written regarding a number within a range such as "1000 to 4999".

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
